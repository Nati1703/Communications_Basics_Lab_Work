# Communications_Basics_Lab_Work
The repository contains lab works related to communication basics and focuses on the design of transmitters (BPSK and QPSK) and receivers with a focus on modulation and demodulation using Simulink. It also contains code for implementing Delay and FIR filter blocks in MATLAB, as well as a Digital Phase Locked Loop (PLL) block in MATLAB.
